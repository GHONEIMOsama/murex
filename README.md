# GhoneimMurexProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.29.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Developpement

Facing some problems with stackblitz I decided to create a new projet doing the same thing as the one on stackblitz. Instead of using the json file in which I couldn't post a new ticket using the httpClient, I decided to use a list in ticketService.
I choosed Angular 8 because it's the version I used to work with. 

### features

#### CREATE
- You can create a new ticket by clicking on the button **CREATE A NEW TICKET**.

#### UPDATE
- You can update a ticket by clicking on it wich will open a form to update the ticket.

#### DELETE
- You can delete a ticket by clicking on the button delete showed on the ticket.

#### Technical notes

- Creation of one component for creating and editing a ticket.
- Using Angular routing.
- Implement the design using just css.



## Unit testing

I didn't implement any because I don't know how to implement them for front part. I implemented unit tests and integration tests for back part using Java - Spring.
